## Database
- A SQLite database is used to store game information.
- Each round’s data is saved in a dedicated table, including:
  - Winner’s name , Player number, Player color , Round start time (`startdate`) ,  Round end time (`enddate`)
- This enables later analysis, game history review, and player performance statistics.
-  Every completed round is recorded in a rounds table within the database.
- Round results are saved immediately after the round ends to ensure data integrity.
- This table can be used to retrieve past game sessions, replay rounds, or track player progress over multiple rounds.

## Continue Prompt
- After each round, a prompt asks players if they want to continue playing.
- If players agree, a new round starts with the board reset but scores retained.
- If players decline, the game ends and a final summary is displayed.
- This feature improves user experience by allowing seamless multiple rounds without restarting the game manually.
